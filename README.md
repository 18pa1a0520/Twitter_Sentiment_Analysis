# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
This project addresses the problem of sentiment analysis in twitter; that is classifying tweets
according to the sentiment expressed in them: positive, negative or neutral. Twitter is an online microblogging and social-networking platform which allows users to write short status updates of
maximum length 140 characters. Analysing the public sentiment is important for many applications
such as firms trying to find out the response of their products in the market and predicting
socioeconomic phenomena like stock exchange. The aim of this project is to develop a functional
classifier for accurate and automatic sentiment classification of an unknown tweet stream with the
help of tweepy and a website application interface
